fail2ban rules for FileMaker Server

These files are not a full set of files for fail2ban, merely files that can be added to a fail2ban installment so that the relevant FileMaker Server logs can be included.

To install the fail2ban core files, you can use the source at fail2ban.org, or a Mac OS package manager like MacPorts or Homebrew.
